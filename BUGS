* dispatching nested lambdas is currently broken in QtDispatch 
  on MS Visual Studio 2010 SP1. See test Qt_dispatch_cascade 
  for a workaround (using runnables)
* when dispatching a lot of work items at once, the number of 
  threads on windows and linux will explode but decrease quite
  fast again
* periodic timers have an increasing delay the longer they run
 (see dispatch_drift test). This might be due to an implementation
  error of EVT_FILT_TIMER on windows.
