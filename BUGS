* dispatching nested lambdas is currently broken in QtDispatch 
  on MS Visual Studio 2010 SP1. See test Qt_dispatch_cascade 
  for a workaround (using runnables)
* when dispatching a lot of work items at once, the number of 
  threads on windows and linux will explode but decrease quite
  fast again
* periodic timers have an increasing delay the longer they run
 (see dispatch_drift test). This might be due to an implementation
  error of EVT_FILT_TIMER on windows.
* Due to an implementation bug in gcc 4.5.1 regarding the destruction
  of lambdas, all variables used from within a block but created
  in the outer scope will not get properly deleted as the lambdas
  will never be freed. Issue seems to be nonexistend when using
  clang and can easily eradicated within VS 2010 when creating
  lambdas on the heap instead of the stack by using an explicit new.
