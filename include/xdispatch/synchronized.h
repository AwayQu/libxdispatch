/**
  @def synchronize( lock )

  This macro is used to implement Qt's synchronize keyword. The lock
  parameter is an object is a variable of type synclock.

  If you're worried about namespace pollution, you can disable this macro by defining
  the following macro before including xdispatch/dispatch.h:

  @code
   #define XDISPATCH_NO_KEYWORDS
   #include <xdispatch/dispatch.h>
  @endcode

  @see XDISPATCH_SYNCHRONIZE()

  Provides an easy way to make certain areas within your
  code threadsafe. To do so, simply declare a synclock object
  at some point in your code and pass it every time you need to make sure
  some area in your code can only be accessed exactly by one thread. Pass
  the same object to several synchronize() {} areas to ensure that a thread
  can only be within exactly one of those areas at a time.

  @code
    // somewhere declare your lock
    synclock age_lock;

    // the variable that is protected by this lock
    int age = 0;

    // a method that can be called from multiple threads safely
    void increase_age(){

        // this area is completely thread safe. We could
        // use the QDispatchSyncLock object within another
        // area marked the same way and only one of them
        // can be accessed at the same time
        synchronize(age_lock) {
            // everything done in here is threadsafe
            age++;
            std::cout << "Age is" << age;
        }
    }

    // another method that can safely be called from multiple threads
    void check_age(){

        // by re-using the age_lock we ensure that exactly one
        // thread can either be within the synchronize(){} block
        // in increase_age() or within this block
        synchronize(age_lock) {
            if(age > 18 && age < 19)
                std::cout << "Hey wonderful";
        }
    }
  @endcode

  Tests have shown that marking your code this way is in no
  way slower than using a mutex and calling lock()
  or unlock() every time.

  The advantage of using the synchronized keyword over a classical
  mutex is that even if you throw an exception within your code or
  have several ways to return from the function it is always ensured
  that the synchronized area will be unlocked as soon as your program
  leaves the piece of code within the brackets.

  In contrast to synchronized you need to
  manage the lifetime of the lock object yourself.

  If you're worried about namespace pollution, you can disable this macro by defining

  @code
   #define XDISPATCH_NO_KEYWORDS

  @see XDISPATCH_SYNCHRONIZED( lock )


  Provides an easy way to mark an area within your
  code threadsafe. To do so, simply enclose the used
  area with a 'synchronized{ }' statement.

  In constrast to synchronize() you can mark individual
  areas threadsafe only.

  @code
    // the variable that is protected by this lock
    int age = 0;

    // a method that can be called from multiple threads safely
    void increase_age(){

        // this area is completely thread safe
        synchronized {
            // everything done in here is threadsafe
            age++;
            std::cout << "Age is" << age;
        }
    }

    // another method that can safely be called from multiple threads
    void check_age(){

        synchronized {
            // everything done in here is threadsafe
            // as well, but can be called at the same
            // time as the synchronized block of increase_age
            if(age > 18 && age < 19)
                std::cout << "Hey wonderful";
        }
    }
  @endcode

  Tests have shown that marking your code this way is in no
  way slower than using a mutex and calling lock()
  or unlock() every time. However please note that
  locking is a bit slower than when using synchronize(){} and
  managing the synclock by yourself. Additionally the internally
  used synclock objects will exist as long as the entire
  program is executed and cannot be deleted.

  The advantage of using the synchronized keyword over a classical
  mutex is that even if you throw an exception within your code or
  have several ways to return from the function it is always ensured
  that the synchronized area will be unlocked as soon as your program
  leaves the piece of code within the brackets.

  In contrast to synchronized you need to
  manage the lifetime of the lock object yourself.
