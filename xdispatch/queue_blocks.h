 * @function dispatch_async
 *
 * @abstract
 * Submits a block for asynchronous execution on a dispatch queue.
 *
 * @discussion
 * The dispatch_async() function is the fundamental mechanism for submitting
 * blocks to a dispatch queue.
 *
 * Calls to dispatch_async() always return immediately after the block has
 * been submitted, and never wait for the block to be invoked.
 *
 * The target queue determines whether the block will be invoked serially or
 * concurrently with respect to other blocks submitted to that same queue.
 * Serial queues are processed concurrently with with respect to each other.
 * 
 * @param queue
 * The target dispatch queue to which the block is submitted.
 * The system will hold a reference on the target queue until the block
 * has finished.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to submit to the target dispatch queue. This function performs
 * Block_copy() and Block_release() on behalf of callers.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.

 * @discussion
 * Passing DISPATCH_TIME_NOW as the "when" parameter is supported, but not as
 * optimal as calling dispatch_async() instead. Passing DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER
 * is undefined.
 *
 * @param when
 * A temporal milestone returned by dispatch_time() or dispatch_walltime().
 *
 * @param queue
 * A queue to which the given block will be submitted at the specified time.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block of code to execute.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.

/*!
 * @function dispatch_sync
 *
 * @abstract
 * Submits a block for synchronous execution on a dispatch queue.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Submits a block to a dispatch queue like dispatch_async(), however
 * dispatch_sync() will not return until the block has finished.
 *
 * Calls to dispatch_sync() targeting the current queue will result
 * in dead-lock. Use of dispatch_sync() is also subject to the same
 * multi-party dead-lock problems that may result from the use of a mutex.
 * Use of dispatch_async() is preferred.
 *
 * Unlike dispatch_async(), no retain is performed on the target queue. Because
 * calls to this function are synchronous, the dispatch_sync() "borrows" the
 * reference of the caller.
 *
 * As an optimization, dispatch_sync() invokes the block on the current
 * thread when possible.
 *
 * @param queue
 * The target dispatch queue to which the block is submitted.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to be invoked on the target dispatch queue.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.

 * @function dispatch_apply
 *
 * @abstract
 * Submits a block to a dispatch queue for multiple invocations.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Submits a block to a dispatch queue for multiple invocations. This function
 * waits for the task block to complete before returning. If the target queue
 * is a concurrent queue returned by dispatch_get_concurrent_queue(), the block
 * may be invoked concurrently, and it must therefore be reentrant safe.
 * 
 * Each invocation of the block will be passed the current index of iteration.
 *
 * @param iterations
 * The number of iterations to perform.
 *
 * @param queue
 * The target dispatch queue to which the block is submitted.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to be invoked the specified number of iterations.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
