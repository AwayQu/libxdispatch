Description: C++ API for Grand Central Dispatch
 Provides a C++ object-oriented programming interface for utilizing
 the functionality of Grand Central Dispatch
 .
 As an alternative to blocks, the C++11x lambda syntax is supported when
 using gcc 4.5.1 and above. Additionally classes for modeling task 
 hierarchies as well as asynchronous programming are provided.
 .
 For convenience this library will extend the libdispatch API to support
 C++11x lambdas as well
