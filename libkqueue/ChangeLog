------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Add a counter that increments on each each kevent() call. When printing
   debug information within kevent(), display the value of the counter.
   This will be helpful when debugging a multithreaded program that may have
   multiple kevent() calls executing in parallel.    (Credit: Julien Blache)

2010-09-18  v1.0  r344
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Support older Linux kernels that do not have the EPOLLRDHUP flag.

  * Add a portable implementation of the EVFILT_TIMER filter.

  * Add Solaris to the list of supported platforms.

  * Fixed the 'make rpm' target to work on CentOS 5.

  * Modified the manpage to remove unimplemented features.

2010-08-05  v0.9.3  r309
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fix a typo in kevent_copyin() that caused EV_RECEIPT to set the
    data field incorrectly in some cases. 
    (Credit to Julien Blache for discovering and fixing this bug)

2010-08-05  v0.9.2  r289
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fix some build failures on 32-bit platforms related to the debugging
    codepaths being enabled by default.

2010-08-04  v0.9.1  r286
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Prevent dumping of EVFILT_VNODE debugging information to STDOUT.

  * Fix the 'make clean' target in the testsuite.

2010-08-01  v0.9    r285
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Set kevent.data = 1 for passive sockets that have at least one pending
    connection.  
    (Credit to Julien Blache for finding and researching this bug)

  * Fix various compilation errors under Solaris.
    (Credit to Joakim Johansson for testing and providing patches)

  * Use the KQUEUE_DEBUG environment variable to turn on debugging output.

2010-07-21  v0.8    r264
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fix a bug that prevented a knote with the EV_DISPATCH flag from
    being re-enabled after an event had been triggered. 
    (Credit to Julien Blache for finding and researching this bug)

2010-06-08  v0.7    r248
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Add Debian packaging to the ports/ directory and improve the 'make deb'
    target.

  * Set the library soname version.

  * Switch from -fPIC to -fpic as the default in CFLAGS.

2010-03-28  v0.6    r238
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Experimental Linux kernel module.

  * Implement knote modification for signals.

  * Implement POSIX signal.c 

2010-02-09  v0.5    r200
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Prevent namespace pollution by hiding all ELF symbols except for 
    kqueue() and kevent().

  * Add reference counting to the garbage collection mechanism so that
    a kqueue object is never destroyed while multiple threads are using
    it.

  * Improve scalability by using red-black trees instead of linked lists.

  * Refactor the internal API to promote modularity and code reuse. 
    Five methods are added to each filter: create, modify, delete,
    enable, disable. These replace the copyin() method, which was
    overly complicated.

  * Remove the fine-grained locking at the filter level, and replace
    it with coarse locking inside kevent(). This simplifys the locking
    implementation and provides a stronger guarantee of reentrancy.

  * Initial attempt at writing a Linux kernel module. It fails to
    link because sys_epoll_create() and other event-related syscalls
    are not available to kernelspace (?). Need to ask LKML for guidance.

  * Make unit tests threadsafe and created a stresstest which runs
    the unit tests in parallel.

  * Use helper functions to reduce the amount of duplicate code in the
    unit tests.

2009-12-26  v0.4    r133
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Incomplete and experimental support for Solaris added.

  * Lots of work on the test suite.

  * Replace the buggy GC thread with an event-based alternative.

  * Do not implicitly set EV_CLEAR in the EVFILT_USER filter.

  * Adjust the eventlist when EV_RECEIPT causes it to be modified.

2009-11-10  v0.3    r84
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The EVFILT_USER filter has been implemented, but needs additional
    testing.

  * The EVFILT_PROC filter is partially implemented on Linux, but is
    currently broken.

  * The unit tests have been moved to a separate subdirectory and now
    function under OpenBSD 4.4 using the native kqueue(2) and kevent(2)
    system calls.

  * The kqueue_free() function has been removed. 

  * A helper thread performs garbage collection when close(2) is called
    on the file descriptor returned by kqueue().

  * All symbols in <sys/event.h> that are not implemented are now
    undefined.

  * Major internal reorganization of the source tree.

  * A copy-and-paste error in vnode.c has been fixed.

  * The pthreads library is now required.

2009-11-07  v0.2    r59
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Implement EVFILT_TIMER on Linux.

  * Fix another 'make install' problem reported by Mario Schwalbe.

  * Do not link the test program with the pthreads library.

  * pkg-config no longer requires linking with -lpthread and -lrt.

2009-11-05  v0.1     r49
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Initial stable release.
