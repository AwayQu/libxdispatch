@mainpage XDispatch - Overview
@section intro_sec Introduction

XDispatch provides the power of Grand Central Dispatch not only on Mac OS 10.6+
but also on Windows and Linux. The XDispatch framework consists of three libraries:
 - \ref dispatch
 - \ref xdispatch
 - \ref qtdispatch


Please see Apple's documentation on http://developer.apple.com and the libdispatch project at http://libdispatch.macosforge.org
as well.

See the \ref change_log or the <a href="http://opensource.mlba-team.de/xdispatch/news.htm">NEWS PAGE</a> to get to know the recent development.

@subsection x1 libdispatch - the 'original' (plain C) Interface

The entire Grand Central Dispatch interface is available and can be found in \ref dispatch library.
 
Please note that including <dispatch/dispatch.h> is entirely sufficient and will
automatically include all other headers as well.

@subsubsection x111 Use of system provided implementations

On some platforms (namely Mac OS) a version of the libdispatch library is installed by default.
Consequently on each platform xdispatch is built on, the build system will automatically search for existing dispatch implementations  (possibly integrated
deeper than this user space implementation can do). If found, this "native"
implementation will automatically be used. If no implementation is available, our own will be used.

Currently a native libdispatch is available on Mac OS X 10.6+ only and therefore will only be used when built on that
platform.
 
@subsection x11 libxdispatch - a C++ Interface

As a first level of abstraction we created a plain C++ interface providing a more object-oriented way of programming. Detailed
information can be found at the related page \ref xdispatch.

@subsection x2 Qt Interface

Additionally an interface design in a 'Qt-like' fashion was created. All needed work was done to integrate it with Qt's main
event loop. For more information, please see the document on \ref qtdispatch
 
@section x3 GCD's use of Blocks
 
When Apple introduced Grand Central Dispatch it extended its compilers by a new feature they called "Blocks". Basically this
is lambdas (sometimes called closures as well). They allow an easier way to utilize the libdispatch api and are available when using
Clang or the gcc 4.2 that's shipped with Apple's current Developer Tools.

On compilers implementing the block syntax, it is fully functional when using this port. However we support way
more compilers when using the C++ interface \ref xdispatch. Please see the documentation found over there for
extended details.
 
@section x4 Requirements

Requirements differ depending on your goals. Please see the \ref requirements page for details.

@section m1 Get a copy

Since version 0.3 libXDispatch is provided as ready-to-use binary package within the downloads
section at <a href="http://opensource.mlba-team.de/xdispatch/files">http://opensource.mlba-team.de/xdispatch/files</a>.

The current xdispatch sources can both be browsed at http://opensource.mlba-team.de/websvn 
and are accessable using subversion as well. To get your own copy, run:

@code
svn co http://opensource.mlba-team.de/svn/xdispatch/trunk
@endcode

Please be aware that this is a project still in progress. As such we might introduce interface
changes and new functionality until reaching version 1.0 - have a look at the \ref change_log
for details and the current progress. When using this library within a project we recommend to use
one of the tagged versions or the stable branch available by using subversion:

@code
svn co http://opensource.mlba-team.de/svn/xdispatch/tags/<version number here>
svn co http://opensource.mlba-team.de/svn/xdispatch/branches/stable
@endcode

Those versions were tested on a lot of platforms and should be stable to use. Nevertheless you are encouraged to update
to the latest version whenever a new release is published as this way you will benefit of further bugfixes, enhanced performance and
new functionality of libxdispatch providing even better means for implementing concurrent software.

Please do not forget to take a look at the sections concerning \ref requirements and a way for \ref tutorial. In case you want to report a
bug or contribute to this project, please contact us using email via xdispatch (at) mlba-team.de or subscribe to the mailing list at <a href="http://opensource.mlba-team.de/mailman/listinfo/libxdispatch">
